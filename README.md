Data Governance Implementation and Security Threat Elimination
# Abstract
It is an unavoidable reality that large and damaging incidents of computer crime can be carried out by organization insiders. The assumption that “the bad guys” are on the outside is no longer the primary actuality concerning data security. It is imperative for all organizations to strengthen their data governance and security programs to protect sensitive and proprietary information while eliminating the potential for improper data access and utilization. The term “data governance” is a general term that covers the practices and policies organizations create and abide by to ensure proper management and utilization of their data. Data security is the process of protecting data from unauthorized access and corruption. To implement data governance and eliminate data security threats, the best-in-class tools for authentication, authorization, and integration are recommended: Kerberos, Apache Ranger, and Apache Atlas.
